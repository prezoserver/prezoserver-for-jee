  This resource may be used to test the CSRF configuration for a Java based 
  implementation of PrezoServer downloaded from 
  http://prezoserver.org/implementations.
  
  The prezoserver.org Java implementation is configured to protect any resource
  under api/. This is done via a filter so no CSRF specific code has to be
  added to this file.
